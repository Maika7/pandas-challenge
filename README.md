PyCity Schools Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes district-wide standardized test results for math and reading scores to provide insights for strategic decision-making regarding school budgets and performance. The analysis involves combining and processing data from multiple datasets to calculate key metrics such as overall passing rates, average scores, and trends by school type, size, and spending.

Tools and Technologies
Python
Libraries: Pandas, Pathlib
Jupyter Notebook
Git/GitHub

Key Analysis and Results
District Summary
Calculated key metrics such as total schools, total students, total budget, average math and reading scores, and overall passing rates.
School Summary
Generated metrics per school, including:
Average test scores
Total and per-student budgets
Passing percentages for math, reading, and overall.
Performance Insights
Top and Bottom Schools:

Identified highest and lowest-performing schools based on overall passing rates.
Scores by Grade:

Compared average math and reading scores for each grade (9th–12th) across schools.
Scores by Spending:

Analyzed performance trends across spending ranges (<$585, $585–630, $630–645, $645–680).
Scores by School Size and Type:

Investigated the impact of school size (Small, Medium, Large) and type (Charter, District) on performance metrics.
Observations
Spending vs. Performance:

Schools with lower per-student spending tend to perform better on average in both math and reading.
School Size:

Smaller schools (<1000 students) show higher overall passing rates compared to larger schools.
School Type:

Charter schools outperform district schools in average scores and passing percentages.
